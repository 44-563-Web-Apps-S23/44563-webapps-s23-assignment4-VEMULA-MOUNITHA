        <P>
            Where can she be? Mayhap at Neighbor Ainslee's.

     He goes hurriedly out through the hall door. The banging of the
     outside door is heard. The clock door once more slowly opens and_
     BETTY _peers forth, listening. The sound of a door opening causes
     her to draw back. As the noise is further emphasized by approaching
     footsteps, she pulls the clock door quickly to._ CHARLES _enters.
     He looks inquiringly about, tosses his hat on the table, and goes
     for the clock. He opens it with a gay laugh._ BETTY _steps forth
     out of the clock, very much assisted by_ CHARLES.

        <P>Blessed relief! Thou art in very truth, then, flesh and blood?</P>
        <h5><div class="BETTY">BETTY</div></h5>
        <P>And what else should I be, forsooth?</P>
        <h5><div class="CHARLES">CHARLES</div></h5>
        <P> [_Laughing._] </P>
        <p> marked thee for a mummy there entombed.</P>
        <h5><div class="BETTY">BETTY</div></h5>
        <P>[_Disengaging her hand._] </P>
        <p> ? Darest thou?</P>
        <h5><div class="CHARLES">CHARLES</div></h5>
        <P>A lively mummy now thou art come to, whilst I </P>
        <p> [_sighs_]--I
            waited through the ages!</P>
        <h5><div class="BETTY">BETTY</div></h5>
        <P>[_Laughingly._] </P>
        <p>A veritable monument of patient grief.</P>
        <h5><div class="COTTON">COTTON</div></h5>
        <P>Humph! Grounds! For a ring! Aye, there'll be no diabolical circle here for the devil to daunce in. I will question Betty thereon.
           [_Rises._]</P>
           <p>Do thou remain here and I will send her to thee. Oh, that he should offer daughter of mine a ring!
           [COTTON _leaves the room_].</p>
           <p> ADONIJAH _leans back in his chair in supreme contentment at the turn affairs have taken. The clamorous
           knocker arouses him from his reverie. He gazes stupidly around. The continued imperious tattoo on the knocker finally brings him to his
           feet. He goes into the hall and opens the door. His voice is heard.
        </P>

        <p> Good-afternoon, Sir Charles, mine host is absent.</P>
